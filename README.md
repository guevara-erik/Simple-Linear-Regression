# Study - Score Correlation - Univariate Linear Regression

Problem to solve: How long do you have to study to get a specific score. We can try to see a pattern in that data and predict a score based on how many hours the subject studies.

Example: You study 5.1 hours, and you get a 47% on the test, you study 9.2 hours, and you get an 88% score.
